# ToDo List App
In our app, we’ll be able to add tasks to a list, mark them as
completed, remove them from the list, and store them in the browser’s
LocalStorage, a web storage API that allows us to persist data in the
browser so that even after we refresh the page or close the browser, our
tasks will still be available.
